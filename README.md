## Requirements

## Technical Details

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and Socket.IO
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas
- **Real-time communication**: WebSocket (Socket.IO)
- **Game loop**: Server-side at 10 FPS (100ms intervals)
- **Rendering**: Client-side at 20 FPS (50ms intervals)

## Game Rules

1. Eat red food to grow and score 10 points
2. Eat golden stars to get invincibility and score 50 points
3. Avoid walls and other snakes (unless invincible)
4. Golden stars appear randomly (15% chance after eating food)
5. Golden stars disappear after 10 seconds if not eaten
6. Invincibility lasts 10 seconds after eating a golden star
7. When you die, you can refresh to rejoin
8. Compete for the highest score on the leaderboard!

## Tips & Strategy

- Use diagonal movement to navigate faster
- Collect golden stars for safe exploration
- During invincibility, you can pass through everything
- Use wall wrapping during power-ups to surprise opponents
- Watch the leaderboard to see who's winning
- Your snake has a yellow border so you can identify it easily

## Troubleshooting

**Server won't start:**
- Make sure Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Check if port 8000 is available
- Try: `npm install` to reinstall dependencies

**Can't connect from other devices:**
- Make sure all devices are on the same WiFi network
- Check firewall settings
- Use the IP address shown when server starts

**Game feels laggy:**
- Server updates at 100ms intervals (normal)
- Check your network connection
- Fewer players = smoother gameplay

```bash
./start.sh
```

This runs a simple HTTP server without multiplayer features.
